//onsider the following code, where we have a base class B, and a derived class D. 
//Base class B has a virtual function f(), which is overridden by a function in the derived class D, i.e., D::f() overrides B::f().
//Now consider lines 30-34, where the decision as to which classâ€™s 
//function will be invoked depends on the dynamic type of the object pointed to by basePtr. 
//This information can only be available at the runtime, and hence f() is subject to the dynamic binding
